## What is implemented:
  Which goals did I pursue while creating this project:
    - To implement a store prototype for my photos using redux.
    - To understand logic of transferring props between components.
    - To create a page for each product
    - To create admin panel implementation, to expand with date base

  What the admin panel includes:
    - Adding and deleting product cards
    - Password login

    - Products with "buy" button which leads to the page with a particular product
